A simplified version of the BKM-129X compatible board.

Should be able to be created at $25-30, with the ADG1611 being the most expensive component.

This requires an Arduino Nano v3 loaded with the BKM-129X-MCU code from https://github.com/skumlos/bkm-129x-mcu

For now only tested on a PVM-9L2.

You are welcome to clone, produce and sell hardware based on this. Please keep changes and so on open source.

Cool kids give credit where due.
